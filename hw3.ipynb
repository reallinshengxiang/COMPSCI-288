Your next task is to implement CKY decoding, which will be used to find the highest-scoring tree under the model (i.e. the set of span label assignments with highest probability, among all sets where none of the spans intersect).  You can reference the parsing lecture slides if you aren't sure where to start.  Note that the lecture slides CKY required special handling for unary chains, but you will not need to implement this case because we have collapsed all unary chains into a single label.  Also, while traditional CKY had to maximize over production rules (between a span label and its children's labels), here we can maximize over span labels independently because we aren't modeling interactions between adjacent labels.\n\nCKY is designed to handle binary trees, but some productions have greater than two children.  For this project, we will handle non-binary productions by allowing intermediate dummy nodes with a special null label, implemented in the code as an empty string '' at index 0 in SPAN_LABELS.  All non-spans are assigned this label.  You should allow your CKY to select spans with the null label, but then collapse them out when creating the tree.  For example, to create a trinary production \"(A  b c d)\", CKY would select a tree that looks like \"(A  b (null  c d))\" or \"(A  (null  b c) d)\" and then would remove the null nodes to get \"(A  b c d)\" like we wanted.\n\nYou will find that if you allow CKY to select null labels and you directly use log probabilities as the scores, you will often end up with trees made up entirely of null labels.  This happens because many spans have a very high probability assigned to the null label (because they clearly shouldn't be a constituent), and choosing a maximum probability tree will be biased towards selecting these.  To avoid having high-probability null labels competing with non-null labels, we can normalize our scores in a different way: for each span, we will subtract the score (logit) of the null label from the scores of all the labels (both null and non-null).  This will make all null label scores 0, and scale the other label scores of the span appropriately.  This normalization will make it so that if a local span decision would prefer a non-null label it will have positive score, and thus have higher score than all 0-score null labels.  That way, we will prefer to use spans with non-null labels unless they conflict with eachother.\n\nImplementation tip: Don't forget that it is possible for the tree to have labels on spans of length 1.  These labels will go directly above the part of speech label.  Take a look at the example tree at the beginning of \"Parsing: Setup\", which has a NP span label directly above the NN part-of-speech label.","metadata":{"id":"xDMZUA84NM2R"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def cky_decode(leaves, label_scores_chart):\n    \"\"\"YOUR CODE HERE\"\"\"\n    # BEGIN SOLUTION\n  \n    # END SOLUTION\n\n    if 'you have not implemented this function yet':\n        print('Leaves are:')\n        print(leaves)\n        print('label_scores_chart has the following shape:')\n        print(label_scores_chart.shape)\n        raise NotImplementedError()","metadata":{"id":"Bk1v6zptPrtL","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code below runs the parser on the validation data and displays one of the trees.","metadata":{"id":"ZF7gyh-HNY7W"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"predicted_dev_trees = predict(parsing_model, 'dev')\npredicted_dev_trees[6]","metadata":{"id":"T3CLSr4cQODq","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Final evaluation","metadata":{"id":"TFbnEobgQIWx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The standard evaluation for parsing is typically performed using the EVALB software (https://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/).

Some examples of what you could do: \n\n* Analyze precision-recall curves, training graphs, or other experimental statistics. \n* Comparison of model performance across word categories or sentence types (e.g. NP vs VP), accompanied by appropriate statistics. \n* A qualitative analysis of how your model resolves instances of structural ambiguity in sentences you write (https://allthingslinguistic.com/post/52411342274/how-many-meanings-can-you-get-for-the-sentence-i).\n* etc.\n\nFor full credit, your report should include the following: \n1. An in depth analysis of your choice into an aspect of the model's parsing behavior. \n2. Figures supporting your analysis, e.g. plots, tables, parse trees predicted by your model and ground-truth trees from the development set, etc. \n\nWhen you submit the report, name it **report.pdf**.
